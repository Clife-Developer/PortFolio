             I am a motivated, confident, and results driven computer science graduate from Lobachevksy State University. 
             I am currently a junior self-taught sofware developer with no professional work experience. I have the ability
             to efficiently prioritize and multitask projects. I always do my best to
             achieve the highest level of quality and efficiency. I enjoy working with other people, especially
             as a team and I am also comfortable working on my own. I also enjoy
             helping other people with their tasks or projects.

              Currently I am a junior level full stack developer with an emphasis on: JavaScript, 
              Angular10+, React.js, Java (programming language), MongoDB, node.js, mongoose, express.js, 
              redux, MongoDB, MySQL, SQL, postman, firebase, REST API, JSON, AJAX, bcrypt, JWT, dotenv, CSS,
              Bootstrap, HTML
              As a frontend developer, I am quite comfortable with the latest trends and standards in Frontend 
              development. I am a fast learner and a team-player. You may count on me being an asset to your project. 
              If the project requires the knowledge of other frameworks, currently not part of my stack, I am willing 
              to quickly learn them.
              As a backend developer, I am quite comfortable with the latest trends and standards in backend

              skills relevant in the world of software development. I am willing to quickly learn any technology 
              that may be required for any project.
